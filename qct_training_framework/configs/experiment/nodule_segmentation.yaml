# to execute this experiment run:
# python src/train.py experiment=nodule_segmentation

train: True # if true train the model
test: True # if true test the model
# if ckpt_path is not none and train is true: load the initial weight from the ckpt_path
# if ckpt_path is not none and train is false: test the model mentioned in ckpt_path

defaults:
  - override /datamodule: nodule_segmentation_datamodule.yaml # Ignore everything mentioned in default train.yaml. Load none dict from /datamodule
  - override /model: nodule_segmentation # Load the /model/nodule_segmentation.yaml config group
  - override /model/net/segmentation: deha_net # Update the above loaded with new config group. /model/net =  /model/net/resunet. This can be changed from commandline too /model/net=attn_unet
  - _self_ # After loading the above merge with below
  # Alternatively instead of writing everything here. we can write yaml files within trainer or callbacks or
  # - override /trainer: nodule_segmentation.yaml
  # - override /paths: nodule_segmentation.yaml

# all parameters below will be merged with parameters from default configurations set above or mentioned in train.yaml
# this allows you to overwrite only specified parameters

# tags to help you identify your experiments
# you can overwrite this in experiment configs
# overwrite from command line with `python train.py tags="[first_tag, second_tag]"`

## Data Module

## Lightning trainer

  # it's slower but normal "ddp" currently doesn't work ideally with hydra

## Defining paths
paths:
  # path to root directory
  # this requires PROJECT_ROOT environment variable to exist
  # PROJECT_ROOT is inferred and set by pyrootutils package in `train.py` and `eval.py`
  root_dir: ${oc.env:PROJECT_ROOT}

  # path to data directory, No data directory is being used.
  data_dir: null

  # path to logging directory
  log_dir: /home/users/souvik.mandal/datasets/model_checkpoints/training

  # path to output directory, created dynamically by hydra
  # path generation pattern is specified in `configs/hydra/default.yaml`
  # use it to store all files generated during the run, like ckpts and metrics
  # defaults to this log_dir/task_name
  output_dir: ${hydra:runtime.output_dir}

  # path to working directory
  work_dir: ${hydra:runtime.cwd}
