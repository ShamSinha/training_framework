- Read [Hydra documentation](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/). A bit of learning curve so, Read and try out tutorials, common patterns, reference manual

- Sample commands to run this repo for nodule_segmentation. We have to write for classification in a similar way.
  python src/train.py experiment=nodule_segmentation

- Link to source repo: https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template . Do read the read me for overview. Most of code is unchanged. So anything mentioned in readme might work.
